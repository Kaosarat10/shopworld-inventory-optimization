# Non-Functional Requirements â€“ ShopWorld Inventory System  
**(How the System Should Perform and Behave)**

## Introduction

In this document, I outlined the **non-functional requirements** for the proposed ShopWorld inventory management solution.

While functional requirements describe **what the system will do**, non-functional requirements focus on **how the system should behave** â€“ including its performance, usability, security, reliability, scalability, maintainability, and compliance.

To ensure the system meets business expectations, I defined each requirement with:
- A **clear non-functional need**
- A **measurable success criterion** to evaluate performance
- Any **assumptions** that must be true for the requirement to be achieved

These requirements were informed by the business context, user environment, and specific needs already documented earlier (like the stakeholdersâ€™ limited digital literacy, the importance of performance and availability, and the need for future growth).
