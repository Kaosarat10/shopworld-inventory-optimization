# ShopWorld To-Be Process (Solution Design)

## Introduction  
This document outlines the **future (to-be) process** designed to improve ShopWorldâ€™s current **inventory tracking and management** system. It addresses the challenges identified in the existing (as-is) process by introducing a more efficient, technology-driven solution.

## Purpose  
The to-be process shows how the recommended system will work in a real business setting. It explains how roles such as warehouse staff, sales team, procurement, and purchasing will interact with the system to complete daily tasks more accurately and faster.

## What the System Will Do 
The system design includes features like:
- Barcode scanning to record stock instantly  
- Real-time inventory tracking across all departments  
- Automatic alerts when stock is low  
- Dashboards that show fast- and slow-moving items  
- Auto-generated reorder requests with complete documentation  

Each step in the process was carefully thought out to reduce manual work, improve accuracy, and support better decision-making across departments.
