# Barcode-Based Inventory Tracking System – Requirement Elicitation Plan

## Overview

This repository contains the Requirement Elicitation Plan for the Barcode-Based Inventory Tracking System project.

The plan outlines the systematic approach used to gather accurate and stakeholder-informed requirements that will guide the development of a practical and reliable inventory management solution.

## Objective

The objective of this requirement elicitation plan is to collect detailed, relevant, and practical information from key stakeholders to inform the design and implementation of a barcode-based inventory tracking system.

## Elicitation Method

**Chosen Method:** Interview

**Rationale:**  
Interviews were selected for their ability to produce in-depth, contextual insights. They allow for flexible dialogue, clarification of misunderstandings, and exploration of specific needs and challenges that structured tools like surveys may not uncover.

## Stakeholders Involved

- Store Managers  
- Warehouse Supervisors  
- Purchasing Managers  
- Vendors  
- Inventory Manager  
- Procurement Manager  
- IT Team

These stakeholders were identified based on their roles, responsibilities, and influence on inventory operations.

## Interview Approach

- **Format:** Semi-structured  
- **Duration:** 30 to 45 minutes  
- **Mode:** virtual  
- **Recording:** Audio (with consent) and notes  
- **Output:** Interview summaries, requirement statements, and categorized stakeholder needs

## Timeline

| Week | Activity                                           | Stakeholders Involved                            |
|------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Interview preparation and scheduling               | All stakeholder groups                           |
| 2    | Interviews with store and warehouse staff          | Store Managers, Warehouse Supervisors            |
| 3    | Interviews with purchasing team and vendors        | Purchasing Managers, Vendors                     |
| 4    | Interviews with inventory, procurement, and IT     | Inventory Manager, Procurement Manager, IT Team  |
| 5    | Consolidation and requirement analysis             | All participants                                 |

## Risk Considerations

- **Stakeholder Availability:** Interviews may be delayed due to competing priorities  
- **Incomplete Information:** Some stakeholders may withhold information without confidentiality assurance  
- **Resistance to Change:** Some stakeholders may be hesitant about digital transformation

**Mitigation Strategies:**  
Engage early, explain the purpose clearly, and present the system as a solution to existing operational challenges.
