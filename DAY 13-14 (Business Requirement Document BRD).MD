#  ShopWorld Inventory Management System – Business Requirements Document (BRD)

##  Project Overview

ShopWorld, a growing retail business, struggled with inefficiencies in its manual inventory tracking system. These challenges resulted in inaccurate stock levels, delayed order fulfillment, and poor visibility across departments. This project introduces a digital Inventory Tracking and Management System to address these problems.

The **Business Requirements Document (BRD)** captures all functional and non-functional requirements, detailed use cases, and the step-by-step operational flow of the proposed solution. It bridges the gap between business stakeholders and technical implementers, ensuring clarity and alignment before system development begins.
