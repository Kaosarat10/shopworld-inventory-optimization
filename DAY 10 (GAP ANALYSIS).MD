##  ShopWorld Gap Analysis 

I conducted a **gap analysis** after carefully designing the **To-Be** process for ShopWorld.
This involved comparing it with their current manual process to identify key gaps.

For ShopWorld, I started by analyzing the current inventory and sales operations, which were mostly manual, prone to errors, and lacked centralized visibility.  

I then mapped a future process powered by an automated inventory management system and compared both to identify the **gaps** and how the new system solves them.

These gaps revealed what needed to change and helped validate if the solution I proposed truly addressed the business problems.  
ShopWorld was battling with a **manual inventory tracking and management system**, which led to inefficiencies and stock errors.

- It helps to:
- Spot missing functionalities
- Reveal process inefficiencies
- Identify data or system limitations
- Propose clear actions to bridge those gaps

### The System I Designed Solves These Problems by:
- Tracking inventory levels in **real-time** across all departments.  
- Sending **automatic alerts** when stock levels fall below a defined threshold.  
- Displaying **dashboards** for fast-selling and slow-selling items.  
- Enabling **barcode scanning** to instantly update inventory records.  
- Giving the **sales, store, and procurement teams** unified access to accurate data.  
- Automatically **generating reorder requests** when stock reaches the reorder point.

These gaps identified earlier are now **effectively bridged** through this solution.
