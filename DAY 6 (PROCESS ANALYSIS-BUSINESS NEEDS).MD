# Process Analysis for Inventory Management System

### Introduction
In this section, I conducted a detailed analysis of the current (as-is) process of inventory management and customer order placement at the shop. The goal was to identify inefficiencies, bottlenecks, and pain points that are affecting the business's day-to-day operations. By examining the process closely, I was able to bring out areas that needed improvement for better workflow and customer satisfaction.

### Pain Points, Inefficiencies, and Bottlenecks

- **Pain Points**: These are the areas where the business or customers experience difficulties or discomfort. These could include delayed reordering, stockouts, poor customer satisfaction, and slow sales processes.
  
- **Inefficiencies**: These are the steps or processes where time, effort, or resources are wasted, such as manual entries, duplicated work, and slow data updates.

- **Bottlenecks**: These occur when specific parts of the process slow down or block the overall flow, causing delays. For example, manual stock checks, manual documentation, and delayed order updates contribute to bottlenecks.

# Business Needs / Objectives Document

### Introduction
Based on the process analysis, I translated the identified inefficiencies, bottlenecks, and pain points into high-level business needs and objectives. This helps in framing the key requirements for improving the inventory management system and enhancing business operations.

### Business Needs

In this section, I outlined business objectives aimed at improving the overall efficiency of the inventory process, ensuring that products are available when needed, and reducing manual errors. Key business needs include real-time tracking of inventory, reducing delays in updating records, and improving customer satisfaction by avoiding stockouts.
