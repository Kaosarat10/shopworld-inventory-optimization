# ShopWorld Functional Requirements and Their Relevance to Stakeholders

## Introduction

This document outlines the **functional requirements** of the proposed system—clearly stating what the system will do in practical terms. Functional requirements are the operational actions or features of the system to meet the business needs identified earlier.

These were derived directly from the business needs identified during earlier analysis. For ShopWorld, the goal is to move from manual, delayed processes to an **automated, real-time inventory management system** that connects all departments—sales, procurement, and store—in one seamless workflow.

## Relevance to Stakeholders

The functional requirements in this document have been tailored to align with the roles, responsibilities, and interests of each stakeholder within ShopWorld’s operational ecosystem. By gaining a clear understanding of each stakeholder’s needs, I ensured that the system’s features would provide the necessary tools to support their tasks and decision-making processes.

This helped align the system features with real day-to-day operations and ensured that the requirements are relevant, useful, and directly tied to solving the pain points already identified.
