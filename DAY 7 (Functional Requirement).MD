# ShopWorld Functional Requirements and Their Relevance to Stakeholders

## Introduction

This document outlines the **functional requirements** of the proposed system—clearly stating what the system will do in practical terms. Functional requirements are the expected actions or behaviors of the system, such as how it tracks stock, notifies teams, or updates records.

These were derived directly from the business needs identified during earlier analysis. For ShopWorld, the goal is to move from manual, delayed processes to an **automated, real-time inventory management system** that connects all departments—sales, procurement, and store—in one seamless workflow.

## Relevance to Stakeholders

To ensure the requirements are not just technical specs but meaningful solutions, I grouped them by **stakeholder roles and features**. This was done through a clear understanding of what each stakeholder does, what they struggle with, and what kind of system support would make their job easier.

This helped align the system features with real day-to-day operations and ensured that the requirements are relevant, useful, and directly tied to solving the pain points already identified.
