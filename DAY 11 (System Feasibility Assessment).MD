# SHOPWORLD Inventory System: Feasibility & Requirements Analysis

##  Introduction  
This document was prepared to guide the design of the **SHOPWORLD Inventory System**, a digital solution created to solve a real business challenge of **manual inventory tracking and ordering**.

Many departments like sales, store, and procurement currently track stock and make purchase requests manually, leading to **mistakes, stockouts, and delays**. The new system is built to:
- Automate inventory updates  
- Alert staff when stock is low  
- Speed up reorder processes  

But before building such a system, it’s important to ask:

> “Can we really do this? Is it possible in Nigeria? Can we afford it? Can we finish it before our rollout in October?”

That’s what this document helps to figure out.

##  What This Document Covers  
This document is made up of **two key parts**:
1. **Feasibility Analysis** – Can we really do this in Nigeria, on budget, and on time?  
2. **Requirements Analysis** – What features should the system have? What’s most important?

---

##  How I Did Mine  

###  Feasibility Assessment  
I checked each proposed system feature (e.g., barcode scanning, SMS alerts, dashboards) and analyzed:

- **Technology**: Is it possible in Nigeria? E.g., Are barcode scanners, SMS gateways, dashboards available locally?  
- **Budget**: Can we afford it?  
- **Timeline**: Can we build and test between **May–September** before **October rollout**?

###  Tools/Brands Available in Nigeria
- **Barcode Scanners** – Generic USB models, mobile app scanners  
- **SMS Gateways** – Vellamet, Digitext  
- **Dashboard Tools** – Microsoft Power BI  

These make the plan **realistic and localized**, not vague.

###  Requirements Analysis  
I listed all **core features** the system must have. Then I:

- Highlighted which are **Must-Have** vs. **Optional**
- Identified risks and trade-offs  
  > _E.g., some products like groundnuts may not have barcodes, so custom labeling is needed._

###  MoSCoW Prioritization  
- **Must have**:  
  - Real-time tracking  
  - Barcode scanning for instant updates
  - Low stock alerts  
  - Unified inventory access across departments
- **Should have**:  
  - Dashboards for sales trends  
  - Reorder generation
- **Could have**:  
  - Advanced analytics or predictive stock ordering   
- **Won’t have for now**:  
  - Supplier integration  

---

##  Why It Matters  
By doing this feasibility and requirements analysis:

1. We reduce risk of failure by planning with **real tools and timelines**  
2. Everyone involved knows **what is being built, why, and how it will work**  
3. We avoid surprises and stay on track for the **October launch**

---

##  Next Step  
With feasibility confirmed and core requirements mapped out, the next phase is:

- Designing the system interface  
- Testing scanning, alerts, and dashboard setup  
- Training users in **sales**, **store**, and **procurement** departments
