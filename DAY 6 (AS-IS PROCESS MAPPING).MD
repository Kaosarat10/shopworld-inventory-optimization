# As-Is Process Mapping for  SHOPWORLD Inventory Management

### Introduction
In this section, I created a detailed **As-Is Process Map** to visually represent the current workflow of inventory management and customer order placement at the shop. This process map highlights the existing steps, the flow of activities, and key decision points within the system. By mapping out the process, we can clearly see where improvements can be made to optimize the workflow and reduce inefficiencies.

### Process Mapping Overview
The process map shows the journey from the point when a vendor supplies goods to when a customer places an order, including the steps of recording inventory, sales, and stock management. Key decision points and manual processes are clearly marked, which contribute to bottlenecks and inefficiencies in the system. The As-Is process mapping helped to identify areas that need intervention to streamline operations and enhance productivity.
